If I have a retina display iPad, I want it to look like it has retina display, not a hazy iPad 2. So... I started researching and came across this tempered glass screen protector with promises of easy installation and beautiful retina quality display. I have to admit that I am very impressed with the picture quality and the ease of installation. Best of all, I was able to tear out the plastic screen protector from my Otterbox defender case and use the case without issue. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because of the home button sticker! The sticker is a lame plastic blob that sits on the home button and looks ugly. I thought little of it because I would bury it under the frame of the Otterbox case. Unfortunately it causes slight problems with the use of the home button. If I press for slightly too long (a second) it activates siri. Believe me it's not the end of the world and I love how the screen looks it's just a minor issue that justifies 4 stars.\",\n",

It looks like and responds to all the same command syntax.The camera works well electronically.  I had no problem using the ActiveX mode in Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 11.  The software that comes with this camera was written for Windows XP and requires some compatibility tinkering to run in Win7.  It wasn't stellar when it was written and now it is years out of date.  On the plus side, the built in wifi works very well as mine is a long way from the AP and works without issue.Like a lot of these cameras it was not focused well from the factory which required me to disassemble the lens cover and twist the focus ring.  In so doing I observed there are no rubber seals or very much weatherproofing at all.  The bracket is nice metal and the electronics seem fine but I suspect I will have water and fogging problems with my outside installation.As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.

       "  'reviewText': \"The YN600 is about twice as bright as the YN300 as you might imagine. I believe it's exactly twice as bright just based on my visual assessment. This is VERY bright and with proper bouncing or diffusing can function as a good key light. That's based on my amateur opinion of course.The YN600 doesn't come with a case or bag like the 300, which is a bummer. It only comes with a clear and amber gel but the diffuser clear gel is really more of a protective gel than anything. It doesn't really diffuse anything (same story on the 300) and the light meter on my camera detects only a very minor change in light if any at all when using it. The AMBER is useful though, I like to bounce it off a reflector or through something to create a nice warm light on a subjects face. Your mileage may vary but it's fun to play with.The Yn600 I received DID come with an AC adapter. It works great (previous reviewer should get theirs replaced). It also works great with adapters and it can be controlled via remote either with the same one as the Yn300s or you can actually assign it a channel of its own if you want to control it independently.The remote is a bit nutty as it's the same as the YN600 that has two color temps. So, ya know, deal with it I guess?The things to know about the YN600 are:- 1/4&#34; thread on bottom of light NO HOTSHOE. So if you want to use this with a light stand, you can get adapters to make it happen, but just know that it doesn't use a hotshoe, it uses a 1/4&#34; thread. Unlike the YN300s which have the hotshoe adapter as their primary mounting option. This makes sense, given the 600s size, but it's something to be aware of.- There IS a fan on the backside that turns on when the light is very hot. The fan is NOT silent, but it is not loud either. It is easily worked around with intelligent mic use or you can probably edit it out in post if you hear it at all. It's quieter than a quiet computer but ya know, keep it in mind. Another way around this is to well, turn the light off between takes and/or use a lower brightness setting. It does stay off 90% of the time in my experience and turning the light off will almost always force the fan to reset.- It's a GREAT light! Honestly, I don't know how it could be much better. It does have the same barn doors as the Yn300 which are probably not the greatest for those of you who know how to really shape light. I'll say the same I said for the YN300 - black wrap is probably going to solve any issues you might have with them.So there's my completely amateur opinion. Good luck!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I looked at a number of flat panel LEDs and the reviews concerned me because flickering in the video file seems to be a common thread. Although it might not be visible to the human eye, the video clip is the proof. Recall, that the human eye cannot see the 60hz flicker of sodium and metal halide lamps that light our highways. The human eye cannot even see the flicker of 24 frames per second motion picture film. However, a flickering lamp can have an interference effect with the frame rate of the camera and produce zebra like lines that climb or descend the video image. I decided to purchase this based on the Yongnuo name, reasonable price and the nice appearance on the Amazon page.I shot clips on a Canon 6D at 24 fps and 30 fps and at 10% lamp output, 50% and 100%. I saw no evidence of flickering (the moving zebras) in the footage, 6 clips altogether. That\\'s great.This unit is a 5 star for me. The exposure on the Canon 6D was ISO 200, 8 feet, 1/30 sec at f/6.3. Pretty respectable. The visual impression is that this lamp is very bright. I did a burn-in of 2+ hours at 100% power and the unit survived. The batteries were drained when I came back. I am using 3rd party Amazon purchased \"Sony\" 6900 mAh batteries. It takes two and does not come with batteries, so beware. This unit does have a cooling fan that is activated by internal sensor to keep the LEDs from overheating. When the fan comes on the sound can be picked up by a sensitive condenser microphone but I found it to be manageable by using a shotgun mic hung from a boom and processing noise removal in Audition CC. The power is adjustable from 1% to 100% by the same knob that turns the unit on. It is NOT supplied with AC power (an option) but I don\\'t find that to be a problem because the unit burns for over an hour on batteries and it is so great not to have to bother with accessing power on location. These lamps are a dream on location because they pack into such a small package and set up so quickly. I was able to shoot an indoor interview with bright sun behind the subject. I used 2 of these lamps (yes, I bought a second one after testing the first) one as a key and another as a fill at 50% output. The bright sun coming in the window acted as the kicker light. My exposure was ISO 200, 1/30sec at f/16. The lamps provided just enough light to properly expose the faces and balance the background. Lamps about 3 to 4 feet from subject. Of course, the closer a lamp is to the subject, the softer the light renders on the subject and since there is no heat projected on the subject the closeness to the subject was not a problem.The IR remote works well and allows remote control of the intensity 1% to 100%. Great to be able to turn the lamp off or adjust intensity when it is extended way up a light stand because is is on batter power, after all.Because I did not have the right adapter with me to mount one of the lamps on my &#8541;\" stud light stand, I had to gaffer tape the lamp to the light stand. It held long enough to complete the shoot but came crashing down while breaking down the set. The Yongnuo unit survived the crash with minor scratches, a bent barn door and STILL WORKS. However, one of the batteries was smashed. This is proof enough to me that these lamps can survive some abuse.Highly recommended. I held off writing this review until after I purchased the 2nd lamp and field tested them. Also, I wanted to get my hands on a 2nd one before they become scarce because these are so good.',\n",

It also stopped being able to read dual layered games like Killzone 3 and other random blurays. After contacting sony, they ruled it as a laser lens issue and I would have to send it in costing me $150. Doing the replacement job myself was simple and the part is at a great price. There are a bunch of youtube videos that you can watch as a guide. Make sure you know and order the correct laser model. The new lens and deck was basic plug in play and the included torx t8 screwdriver is needed to open up the chassis. It's now reading games like a new ps3! Save your money and do the repair yourself!\",\n",

Simply put, I've had about 40 pairs of headphones in the past 5 years and these are far and away the best designed and highest quality audio of any of them.  The genius of these headphones is that they nest inside your ear, because of their shape - that means they don't fall out and you don't have to rely on shoving them deep in you ear canal to have them stay. It makes for a more comfortable listening/talking experience and for better audio. They are also sturdy and solid.  At 10 bucks a piece they are also really well priced and I wouldn't feel bad about losing a pair (which I do once every 3 months) - however they are sturdy and don't break like cheap headphones.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"These are, by far, the best earbuds in this price range.They sound great. I've had others that overcompensated when it came to bass. These have clear bass that doesn't overcompensate. The soundstage is also great. I can almost hear the exact locations people are sitting when I listen to podcasts.They're very comfortable. I've always had problems getting earbuds to fit my ears because one seems to be smaller or differently shaped. And, when I did find earbuds that fit, they became uncomfortable over time. These don't have that problem. I'm actually forgotten I was wearing them and pulled my iPhone off my desk. That's high praise! Believe me. :)Since they're so inexpensive, I think I might buy a couple more sets to keep in my computer bag. They would also make good stocking stuffers.\",\n",

These are the only buds I have had that I have not had to constantly re-adjust or place back in my ears after falling out - even while just sitting and even with changing the rubber earpiece size to find a reasonable fit as I have had to do with other buds. They do come with different size rubber earpieces if you need them, but the ones that were already on them fit me fine.I can even lay on my side with the bud in my ear against a pillow and it feels fairly comfortable. This is key since I like to listen to motivational/binaural/subliminal audios as I go to sleep at night.As for looks, I have to admit that they aren\\'t expensive looking at all.

       "  'reviewText': 'These Panasonic earphones do have really good fidelity, as the WireCutter article says.  But they aren\\'t going to blow you away.  The first time I started listening to them, I thought \"geez that\\'s way too much bass\" and I\\'m someone who does like a \"warm\" sound with healthy bass.  But I don\\'t like \"Beats by Dre\" type of bass and I think Panasonic was aiming for that type of customer with their design of the RP-TCM125.  But I have found that the bass has lessened somewhat after break-in and I may keep them.  Though the bottom end is still more prominent than the entire rest of the frequency spectrum and it can be distracting at times (depends on the mix of the song).  The best thing these phones have going for them is the comfort.  For in-ears, they are very comfortable and insert easily.  However, I still have the problem with them that I do with other in-ears -- that they never feel seated 100% and I have to fidget with them every 10 minutes to re-seat them.  Maybe this is what I will always have to deal with unless I get custom-molded in-ears.  The HUGE disappointment with these phones is that they don\\'t have a volume adjustment on them.  You have to pull your phone out of your pocket to adjust the volume.  Maybe that was noted in the WireCutter article and I overlooked it.  I certainly didn\\'t notice it when looking at the Amazon description.  That\\'s my mistake, I know, but I\\'m still disappointed.  I suspect this was a cost-cutting move by Panasonic.  I think it was a design mistake.  However.... considering the dirt cheap price of $15, these phones are an excellent value.UPDATE:  It looks like the Panasonic RP-HJC120-W \"with iPhone controller\" is the same headphone with a volume adjustment.  I\\'m going to see if Amazon will let me swap.',\n",

I have more expensive, better headphones, but for day-to-day use a pair of headphones like these Panasonics are right in the price range of what I use for most of my listening.I read the Wirecutter's review of these and bought a pair to see what I have been missing. The answer; nothing. They are a generally acceptable pair of cheap earbuds with a microphone. I compared them to a couple of other similarly inexpensive earbuds and found that they are not only not better, in some regards they were worse.As someone who rarely (never) reviews products on Amazon, I felt it was necessary to try to bring some perspective to the discussion. These headphones are fine. For the price, they are a good choice. Wirecutter's review made them sound like they are far more than they are regarding their sound&#34;The Panasonic won because they sounded the best. Hands down. They were everyone&#8217;s top choice in terms of sound fidelity. They have a nice overall balance with airy, mellow highs and present-but-not-dominating bass. They sound just as good listening to acoustic guitar as they do hip hop and rock. Nothing pierces, nothing muddies: every frequency plays well with the others. And as you&#8217;ll see with other contenders later, that&#8217;s not often the case in this price range.&#34;When considered alongside their lackluster build quality (from the Wirecutter &#34;their plasticky design won&#8217;t be winning any awards for beauty or construction&#34;) I can say that I will not be purchasing another pair of these. I have been through lots of other sub-$30... actually, sub-$20 as is my rule for day-to-day wear headphones... that sound as good, if not better, and have a better build quality.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've used lots of different ear buds/canal phones, from the junk they give you with your phone up to Etymotic Research.  These Pannys are quite possibly the most comfortable of them all.  With other isolating canalphones, I have to jam the things halfway to my brain to get a good seal.  With these, the body of the phone sits in the outside of your ear, and the plug part just seals against the ear canal.  Usually I use a small tip, with these I use the large.  They stay in, they stay sealed, and the isolation is excellent.  They are very comfortable- you practically forget they're there.  The sound is very good, with adequate bass and fairly flat sounding overall.  The high-mids and high end could be a little more detailed, but in this price range they are at the top of the heap.  I'm going to buy a few more pairs to have around, before Panasonic changes the design and screws it up.\",\n",

I have had them for about a month and use them daily.  When I wear them do the heavens open and angels appear? No, but for $11 headphones they are fantastic.  Much better than anything else I have found for $30 or less. Markedly better than my Apple Earpods or anything I have tried from Skullcandy. They do have a bit of a burn in time so if you buy them give them some time before forming your opinion.  The highs and mids are actually quite good.  The bass is present and better/comparable to the bass on the Earpods, but I will admit it is not powerful by any means.  I find it sufficient for most of my listening, but if you loooove your bass for hip-hop, electronic, dubstep, etc then these may not be for you.',\n",

Only complaint I have is the lack of volume controls (this is a single button unit) and the cords are very thin.  I've put electrical tape on the 3.5mm end and just a bit on the bottom of the buds to prevent problems.  I feel just a few good tugs would pull the connections loose without this reinforcement.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"By far, the best headphones I have ever listened to. I was willing to pay up to $100 for quality headphones that are about quality music, not just about bass; that is not music to my ears. For me, money is a factor so, I did some research. I read an online review of over 100 different sets of earbuds available from all price ranges and these were picked as the best by several sound quality professionals. In short, I love every aspect of them and I couldn't have done better for the money. Of course, no issues with the mic. No issues with them staying in my ear as they are designed to rest against the back of your inner ear once inside. Have yet to run with them, simply pulling them over my ears and then sticking them in has always worked for running/jerking for me though. They do not pull out to jerking while working outside, so don't be worried about that factor. You really can make them stay. If I had any doubts they'd stay in, I would give you a heads up. Hope this helped, a thorough review like this helped me.Pros- Quality sound (Lows, Meds & Highs)- Don't push so far that they irritate ears/promote infections (I am typically prone to these with earphones)- No need to readjust in ear/worry about falling out- Less than $15!! (The guys making $100 headphones are obviously just ripping people off)- Mic- 1 press button (It's all you need)Cons- They do have a wire, and wires do get tangled(Time to untangle earphones, 10 seconds. Quality music in my ears all day long, priceless)- My phone has to have battery to listen to music with them- They weren't freeAs for not having another button to skip songs, there's an app for that. Single press = play/pause, Press + Hold = Skip, Double press = Go back. Triple Press = ?? This goes on and on to your heart's content.Look them up on Google. You will find the review I found for them.Or follow this link to the review (If Amazon allows it)http://www.tested.com/tech/459019-best-cheap-ear-headphones-today-are-12/\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Like other reviewers, i was led here by a meta review of in ear headphones under thirty dollars. These headphones do not disappoint. They have great mids and actually have some atmospheric depth for such a low price. My only complaint is a lack of bass. Im biased though, because my ears are inured to low pitch and deep base. That being said, im absolutely positive i cannot find better headphones than these without spending at least twice the price, particularly with a Mic, which i find absolutely necessary.If you don't need the Mic and want to pay less, the M and M headphones have comparable sound for only five dollars.The only real complaint i have is that if you move around the connector to the audio jack it can cause slight static. This has me concerned that mine may be a little defective. But these are so cheap i don't mind replacing them.\",\n",

They fit snugly, but the design of each earpiece means they can't be interchanged, so if one breaks, you need a new pair, which again, is not a huge problem.Another irksome design choice is the bud itself to which you add/remove rubber earpieces - unlike most earphones, and unlike the removable pieces themselves which have a round base, the base of the buds are oval-shaped and are a bit tricky to place the rubber earpieces onto, just fyi.Lastly, for those who may be curious, the REMOTE/Mic functionality DOES NOT WORK with an iPOD CLASSIC, I've tried. Disappointing, but since they were pretty cheap, I can use them with my iPad instead.I would definitely recommend these as a good every-work pair of headphones.\",\n",

At the very reasonable price of about $20.00, I don't worry about them getting lost or stolen.I like the single button control,it feels a lot more solid than the Apple earbud control. It Panasonic offers a three button option near this price point, I'd be interested.The mic works OK for calls, but usually I must move it closer to my mouth to  be heard clearly. Not a huge deal, because it's so much easier to hear calls in both ears, with external sounds blocked out. A little clip that attached the mic to your collar would solve this problem easily.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I bought these based on the Wirecutter's recommendation. While I like them, I agree with the other reviewers who say that these are over-hyped. The sound is good and these are a decent purchase, but the Wirecutter review fails to mention some of the drawbacks, which I'll address below:1) The sound is good and ear pieces fit fine once you select the correct ear piece size. It ships with three options, so choose which works best for you - this took some trial and error for me. Taking the earpieces off and putting them on is frustrating, because they attach very tightly to the headphones. Ultimately, this is good because it means the tips won't fall off, but getting the right fit is a chore and took longer than I expected.2) The cord is cheaply made, and is the biggest disappointment of the product by far. For comparison, the wires are thinner than the wires of the Apple Earpods, and they tangle more easily than the wires of Apple Earpods do. The cord is the &#34;cheapest&#34; feeling part of the headphones.3) When in use, the microphone is on the right side, not on the left. This doesn't matter much, but it's worth noting. In my experience, this is the opposite of the way most other brands are.4) Due to the removable/interchangeable earpieces, the weighting of the earbuds is off. Because of the styling of the earpiece, the main weight of the headphones is on the outermost section that's furthest from your ear canal, and I feel like these headphones are also heavier than other similar models. Effectively speaking, it means that the earbuds will want to pull out of your ear canal, pulling in an out/down motion, even if the size of the rubber tip is the correct fit for your ear. For me, the headphones ultimately sag, with the middle of the earbud dropping by about half a centimeter. They don't actually fall out of my ears, but I can feel them sag. (And if you question the fit - yes, I've tried all of the sizes of ear tips).  While this effect is always present with any type of similar in-ear headphones, the pulling effect is exacerbated because of the weight and design of this model.These headphones are still a very good deal for the price, but they're not the amazing wonder that the Wirecutter review makes them out to be. If you're like me and were hoping for a replacement for the Apple Earpods that came with my phone, don't bother buying these. They're good, but they're not THAT good, and they aren't worth buying if you already own Apple ones.\",\n",

These are Great head phones......but  Their review made them sound like they were about the best headphone at Any price.  Well, that's not true, but they are the best I have found for this price.It has good, not great bass response.  They don't rattle under the stress of allot of bass, but, I'm a classic rock listener.  When listening to a Dio song, they washed out, just a bit under the strain of, &#34;Last in Line, Live,&#34;  and Lincoln Park's &#34;It Doesn't Even Matter,&#34;  Now that might not be fair, because I was really testing the limits of a pair of $16.00 headphones, but my $149.00 Dre's don't wash out under anything.My point is, if you're expecting the Wirecutter review to be gospel, with the, &#34;Best at any price,&#34; claim, it might be a bit of an stretch.I'd say it was a Great guideline.They have a nice mid, tone, treble, without being too tinny.  Nice full sound, and yes, they do have a good bass response.  They do sound like headphones that cost much, much more, but don't, (As I did), think you're getting Bose, or Dre quality bass.Very pleasant tones, easy to listen to, without cracking your ear drums.Should you buy them?  Absolutely, especially if you don't want to drop too much dime on a pair of phones, we'll all lose one day anyway.  Don't misunderstand what i'm saying,  These are Very, very good headphones, and are the best of several worlds.  Pleasant sound, a Very good working microphone, and comfortable fit.Sound is also a very subjective thing, like a fine wine, or cigar.  Everyone has their favorite.  I'm just saying don't expect a set of Bose, or Dres.Wire cutter got a little too excited.Just one guy's opinion, so please don't slam me too hard, but I just wanted to warn the next person who's expectations might have been just a tad too high.\",\n",

As long as I can hear sound through them, I'm fine! I don't care about clarity (unless it's truly awful!) or bass or anything like that -  mostly I just need to block out (or minimize) annoying noises (like my husband's snoring, or cockatoo's complaining!) and very occasionally listen to my music or watch a movie in a public place (airport, etc.). That's it. Simple. So these fit the bill. Are they awesome? Who knows? Can I hear clearly? Yes. I like to drown out noises/relax myself a bit by listening to nature sounds, like crashing waves, thunderstorms, and other nature-y type stuff, and I can easily hear the all of the noises (including tiny little birds) clearly - so I guess they work.

It\\'s good at best. I found that the sound came in short bursts some times, where as it would be too quiet or too loud. Other times, the bass was overpowering and you couldn\\'t hear the rest of the music.I\\'ll admit it did fit perfectly, but there are some down sides to the \"Ergo fit\" technology, such as the fact that when you are walking, any slight movement of the cords and the result of the cords bumping into each other will result in this annoying \"bumping\" sound.  Much more noticeable when I first got the ear buds, but less noticeable as time went on. I even noticed that sometimes the \"bumping\" sound did not occur at all.In the end, I do regret getting these. I recommend putting in a few extra dollars for a better pair of ear buds (I don\\'t mean shell out 30$ for a brand new pair of Apple ear buds, but perhaps consider buying a used pair).',\n",

My concerns with earbuds are, in order, staying in my ears, build quality, portability and lastly sound.These things stay in my ears, no problem.  Very surprising as most don't without an over-ear clip.As for durability: I keep one set in my pocket at all times that I use while commuting for an hour or so of use each day, plus the wear and tear of being in my pocket.  Another set I keep at work and use for at least 5 hours a day.  A third set I actually use in my sleep and keep them in for a good six hours a night of tossing and turning (I know this is probably horrible for me).  After a few months of this abuse NONE have failed.Portability wise, they're not the best, the cord tangles as you'd expect.  If there was one place they could improve, it'd be a braided cable, or some other cable detangling tech.  I can't really take stars off for this though, they work exactly as expected here.And last, sound quality.  These things sound great!  I really couldn't believe it.  I thought since most of what I listen to are podcasts and talk radio that I wouldn't care, but these sound better than any other ear buds I've ever used.One quibble: the remote is a pretty limited one button affair that I think is pretty common for most iPhone ear buds, but my S.O. likes having volume control on there as well.  Again, this works as expected, and I don't care about volume adjustment (I hit the buttons on the phone through my pocket).I have zero reservations recommending these.\",\n",

They sounded good, but they had nowhere near the clarity of other (more expensive) in-ear earbuds I have owned, including the Etymotic ER-6 or the MEelectronics A151. Still, they're pretty good. Certainly a lot better than many other sub-$20 earbuds out there. It's a market flooded with terrible products. For $10 or $15, I would probably buy these again, but I'm not convinced that they're the absolute best for that price. I'd need to do a lot more searching before I'd say that.If you want quality and clarity, I'd look for in-ear earbuds with what are known as &#34;balanced armature&#34; drivers as opposed to &#34;dynamic&#34; or &#34;coil&#34; drivers. In my experience, they offer far superior clarity. Often they don't have quite as much bass, but in my opinion most of the dynamic drivers have too much anyway.

They look good, fit well, have a decent build quality and, most of all, they sound pretty darn good. I got them to use with my iPod at the gym, or doctor waiting room, even around the house, sometimes plugged into a radio to listen to classical or jazz in stereo, and they perform admirably here.The bass is perhaps a tad on the thin side (not an issue for me as I am not a basshead); it's there and it is reasonably clean (none of that thumping, pounding, drown everything out sonic mud you usually find in inexpensive buds) and more than adequate. I prefer solid mids and crisp, clean highs and these buds deliver well here, especially on vocals. They can get a little sharp/brittle here and there at the high end, but the overall audio is most pleasing, MUCH more so than the bass heavy V-Modas I paid a lot more for.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Okay, so I'm not really super educated on the quality of earphones, but I've noticed a HUGE difference when I've used these when compared with Apple's Earpods and some cheap Skullcandy's from Walmart. These are a LOT better quality in construction and sound than the other headphones I've used that are under $20. I've listened with these headphones to songs that I've listened to thousands of times before- and have noticed the more subtle aspects of the song that I had never heard before with my other headphones or speakers. I won't be happy with anything less than this sound quality anymore.I was a bit skeptical when they came in the mail because of the direction of the buds, but these headphones are probably one of the most comfortable ones I've ever worn. I'm really really happy with them, I would totally buy another pair. I honestly wasn't expecting much when I ordered these after reading some of the more negative reviews, but I've found that they definitely exceeded expectations.For someone that isn't an audiophile and fairly unintelligent with regards to audio specific qualities, these rock. Probably the best pair of headphones that I've ordered to date. The sound is good, and I can't get over the lowness of price for the highness of quality. Honestly, what more do you want from a pair of inexpensive headphones for casual listening? Granted, there's going to be better headphones with a more impressive sound quality, but that's a given. These are only $15. If you want a better sound quality, pay more money. If you don't, buy these.I would highly recommend these to anyone that wants a good pair of headphones without breaking the bank. They're awesome. It's also probably good to mention that the purple color isn't vibrant, it's more of a soft lavender, but I think I like it better this way.\",\n",

With an average price between $10-$15 it's really chump change when you see earphones 10 to 50 times more. What do you get for $15?One of the most comfortable, sonically balanced earphones out there. The half in-ear rests on the outer ear and the nozzle has an oval shape making the silicone tip fit ergonomically into the ear canal (shallow). Isolation is below average. You can still hear things around you pretty well.After 50 hours of burn in playing music non-stop over night for several nights, there were miniscule changes in sound.The bass is nice and punchy but not overpowering. The mids are not recessed at all. and the treble is smooth and extended enough to hear cymbals but not sibilant.The one-button with mic adds value to those who use their smartphone.Build quality reflects its price range. Thin cable, plastic housing, and no gold-plated plug (though it's L-shaped, a plus).I found out about these on thewirecutter.com, which named these their best earphone under $30.My higher fidelity IEM collection range from (from most expensive to least) Sony XBA-4iP, Phonak Audeo PFE132, VSonic GR07, Meelectronic M-Duo, VSonic VSD1/S/LE, SteelSeries Flux, Xiaomi Piston 2.0 and the Monoprice 9927 (the previous best under $30). Even with more expensive IEMs, I can still enjoy these and find the best use as work earphones because I can still hear if my coworker needs my attention or if a machine makes unexpected sounds and I can just wind these up and toss into my desk drawer.Highly recommended!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"So yeah, I got these courtesy of the Wirecutter review, and I'm very pleased with them, unlike their last suggestion of the Monoprice in-ear monitors (nice, but a PitA to put on).  Having tried a ton of cheap, semi-throwaway earbuds, from Skullcandy, Monoprice, Sony, etc,. the Panasonics had the best fit.  Just without any music playing, it isolated far more external noises than other comparable earbuds.  Based on that and comfort, for the price, I easily give it 5 stars.The actual sound quality is very subjective, and w/o blinding and/or actual audio equipment, I'm not going to give my opinions on how clear the highs were or whatever, but certainly everything I listened to sounded good, from news podcasts, classical, jazz, rock, pretty much every type of thing you'd listen on, say, your smart phone,  Speaking of phones, on my Galaxy S3 at least, the remote play/pause button automatically figured out what my default music player was (GoneMad Player) and automatically starts & stops music.  No way to configure it to work with my podcast player though, but I wouldn't expect that level of control.Also, this may seem very minor, but because of the placement of the remote button, on the cable going to your right ear, it's very easy to tell which bud goes to which ear.  I'm not fond of symmetrical headphones where you have to figure out which way they're supposed to go on.  Yes, the buds are angled so you can figure it out at a glance anyway, but the button is even more obvious; just a nice pet peeve they address.  I'm ordering 2 more of these to throw in the car and my laptop bag so I'm never w/o a pair.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My family uses our headphones for music, and I some times make iPhone calls.  My experiences have been with the old apple earbuds, Similarly priced Sony in-ear models, the new Apple earbuds, another in-ear style my wife uses with around-the-ear wraps, and now these.  As I was researching I compared all but the Panasonics.The old Apple earbuds are just terrible -- tinny and fall out and uncomfortable. 'Nuf said.I used the Sony MDR-EX37B model a lot and so did my son and daughter, around $20 and they are much better.  I was mostly happy with them except that when you're in motion the pull of the cord creates a thumping sound.  Both kids managed to break theirs, or lose the removable covers.  But the sound seemed quite good.I find the ones my wife uses for workouts uncomfortable, and the sound is weak.So, figuring that the new Apple earbuds were just ok, I ordered these for listening.  They are very good, far better than the sony model.  The sound is rich and deep as you would expect from an in-ear model, and the materials used seem less prone to the thumping problem. At about the same price, with a microphone, they are a great deal.  I did find that the connection was a little touchy with one ear occasionally dropping out (in particular on an iPad). I think this is likely just a matter of a little breaking in.But as I was comparing all of these options, I was surprised to find that the new Apple earbuds really are outstanding.  They are super-comfortable, with nothing going in the ear, yet stay in place, and have significantly better sound than any of the others -- really clear and nimble sound, not as though it is being forced as I sometimes feel with the in-ear models. I can wear them for hours comfortably. The materials are not sticky, so they stay untangled comparatively well, and they are just smooth at every point of contact.  I know this is a review of the Panasonic model, so I won't dwell on this further ...I think the right conclusion is that the Panasonics are a very good second paid of earbuds for iPhone, etc. They are noticeably better at sound and comfort than similar models at this price point. But if you really want great sound, I am sure there's a step up (and only because the Apple buds, which are god knows how much more expensive, are better) if you are seeking exceptional sound.\",\n",

I recommend that you burn in for at least a day.The phones have a decent bass and high. The ear-buds fit well and won't fall out; they are angled so that the way they fit in your ear will make them stay there without those over the ear loop.

       "  'reviewText': 'These headphones sound OK - they compare well to other generic cheap headphones.  I have had a variety of headphones over the years - overpriced Bose, mid-priced JLabs & Sony, and of course plenty of cheap generic headphones.  At around $20 I was expecting one step up from cheap - a little better build quality, a little better sound quality and more robust wires hence the 2 star rating.  I would have given them 3 stars if they had cost $10 or less.  These  headphones have very thin flimsy wires similar to what you would find on bargain bin ear buds.  From past experience, I am sure these will last a year or so before a wire breaks from bending- either near the plug or near one of the ear buds.  I found the largest size ear bud tips to still be a little too small for me (adult male).',\n",

Like this design.Cons: Could use a little more depth and bass in sound... That said, again, sound is much better than competition in this price range.  The one button remote could be improved as a 3 button.  You cannot control volume from the remote -- only mute, initiate calls, hang up, etc. -- the standard one button functions.  Would love to be able to control volume from headphones even for a dollar or two more if it increased costs.Bottom line:  Got these to replace Sony earbuds which have really gone downhill in quality over recent years and started to fail regularly on me.  These are very good replacements.  Less expensive.  Almost comparable sound during normal human use.  Durable.  Recommend.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Pros:I have two other panasonic earbuds and they are both great, but wanted one with a remote. This delivers on sound quality, though it is a bit more bassy than I think I would prefer. I notice the last ones I had had a tiny hole in the back of the bud, which makes these sealed, so the sound is probably not as crisp either. I could be imagining that because I never would have thought it would make a difference in speakers this small. It does provide good noise isolation.The way that these ear ports are designed, with that offset you see in the photo, makes the fit superior over any other pair of buds that I've had. And you can't mix up L and R.Cons:The cord material is not the soft, squishy stuff you see more often, or that the other Panasonic buds featured. This makes for a noticeable increase in noise that gets transferred as you are moving. The button is also a small square on one side of the remote body, which makes it a more difficult to find than others.One of the silicone inserts was torn upon arrival, but it was no biggie since I have others.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I am an audiophile with high-end sound systems for both my home and cars. For a while now, I had been looking for high quality headphones, but was turned off by the overwhelming bass of popular headphones like the Beats by Dr. Dre. After much research and listening, I liked the sound of headphones from Bang & Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins and Panasonic. The other 2 were out of my price range, so I bought these Panasonic headphones and let me tell you, I have been amazed by their sound quality!These Panasonic headphones have a deep, natural (not overwhelming) bass, warm vocals and clear, crisp treble - everything you want in high quality headphones. However, you HAVE TO BE PATIENT and \"break-in\" these headphones, because out-of-the-box you will hear a muddy sound, which is totally normal. Don\\'t fret - plug them in an iPhone or iPod playing random songs across all music genre for ~8 hours and voila!!  On top of the great sound, these headphones look awesome, feel very comfortable on the head and have a easy to use, in-line remote for volume and even activating Siri on an iPhone, iPod or iPad; sorry, this last feature doesn\\'t work on Android phones or tablets.I should mention that as much as I like these headphones, music taste and sound is of course, very subjective i.e. if you like bass-heavy sound, then I would recommend you look elsewhere, perhaps to the Beats by Dr Dre or Bose headphones.  However, if you are someone like me, who likes to hear the music the way it was recorded, then you should definitely buy these - you will be rewarded with amazing sound and what quite possibly might be the best headphone deal in the market right now :)',\n",

Great sound, great bass, and the amplifier doesn't even make the speakers become distorted (which is golden in the speaker world). They also come with a very big and soft pleather bag to put them in. I find this to be a quality add on that adds a certain luxuriousness to the headphones. And to round it all out it has a built on microphone/volume control that works with apple devices. How cool is that? With the sale price going on right now of only $35 bucks or so (depending) I am planning on buying another pair to save as a gift or to resell to a friend at a higher price. Haha..

But they have to be EQ'd, the mid-bass bump is horrific, overpowering, and muddies the sound. Without at least a 3db drop at 100hz I can't keep them on my head, and not all of the equipment I listen to can accomplish this. I picked them up very cheap, especially compared to the driver size and build quaility, so I might pull them apart and take a look at what is going on internally with these, they might be moddable into something decent, but for now I would advise against buying these unless you are willing to tweak the sound going into them. For roughly the same money I like the Pioneer Steez 808 much better for bass heads.\",\n",

I primarily enjoy instrumental versions of 60s and 70s rock; country; movie and TV themes; Caribbean steel drums; dulcimer and music box. Full symphony orchestras hit the high and the low notes. So I wanted quality headphones for listening without disturbing others.The Panasonic HT480 allows my ears to be inside the cups so there is no pressure. Others cannot hear what I am listening to and I can barely hear them. The highs and the lows are clean and clear. Individual instruments are easy to pick out. Its almost as good as listening to my high end music system.One factor that influenced me to buy this set (even though I had not listened to them) was my experience with the Panasonic brand. I have purchased a variety of consumer products made by them over 3 decades and the quality has always been superb.

Even the fresh, white coloring is a nice touch to these babies.  They were also sturdy when taking them out of the box.  The band is very strong.  The top band is also comfortable.The earcups are also large enough for big ears, like myself.  But when I put the headphones on, I noticed two huge problems.The headphones are too tight of a fit for my head (7 5/8 hat size right now).  I think they'll break in, but it's quite the vice right now.If that wasn't the dealbreaker, the sound quality sure is.  It's HORRIBLY muffled.  As clear as a cheap boombox from the 90s.  Heck, maybe even my boombox was clearer than these guys.  They sound like when I had a double ear infection when compared to my current Shure 440's.Very, very disappointed in this product (especially when I own Panasonic products, such as a Plasma TV) and it will be packed back to Amazon tomorrow.\",\n",

I was very excited when I opened them on Christmas morning and have been very pleased.  First, they are very comfortable, despite bring kinda big and bulky. Even right out of the box I have never had any pain or irritation on my ears from them.  Also, sound isolation is excellent with these. I find that I cannot hear anything but my music when I am listening to them. They also seem to do a great job with sound leakage.  Being someone that does not like leaky headphones, this is something about them that I love. Also, the sound quality is great. They have a very nice bass response while not sacrificing the highs and mids. I have heard things with these that I have never heard in my music. If they sound a bit muddy/distorted out of the box, burn them in. I did so by letting music play in them all night while I slept. It helped tremendously., although mine sounded pretty decent to me right out of the box.Though my thoughts on these are overwhelmingly positive, I did find a couple minor cons in these. First, it would have been nice to have a detachable cable. Since it is not detachable, the whole set of headphones must be replaced if it breaks. That being said though, the flat, single sided cable seems quite durable.  The remote and mic is nice but I wish it was more universal, as not everyone has an Apple device. The other negative is the adjustment mechanism. It is too loose and moves too easily for my liking. Luckily, it seems to be much more secure once the headphones are on my head. These are the only negatives I found. Like I said, they are very minor to me and don't bother me very much.Overall, this is an awesome set of headphones that is well worth the 54.99. (Lightning deal) that my parents paid for them.\",\n",

The sound quality is not distinguishable from in-ear earbuds that come standard with new iPhones, but if you want a large set of headphones like these (for whatever reason), with the volume/pause/skip/reverse functionality on the cord, this is a decent value-priced set.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"These headphones are AMAZING!  I bought these because I needed a pair of headphones to listen to audio when I edited video for school projects and these are some of the best around.  I am not afraid to drop a hundred bucks on a headphones if they are going to be excellent for what I am going to be using them for.  Now some of the studio headphones can be a little cumbersome to figure out and some even need special software to use, but these sounded great right out of the box.  One thing I would recommend as with any pair of headphones is that you burn them in.  White noise is good, but there are tracks on youtube of pink noise, this sound is the best because it uses almost all the frequencies that humans can hear.  There are tracks that are for 10 hours, but for the purpose of burning in headphones don't go longer than twenty minutes.  Once they are burned in you can use these headphones for anything you want to including gaming, music, and editing.There are some pros and cons that these headphones have and I'll start with the pros.-Excellent sound, wide range of output with deep bass (as expected with 50mm drivers) and clean trebles at all volumes-The mic works pretty well, not as good as a stand-alone mic of course but it gets the job done-Nice durability, have had no problems with them, even after dropping them a couple of timesNext the cons.-They are not very comfortable, it might be just me because I have a tall head but the top of the headphones are a little hard-The headphones don't fold very flat, they do fold but I find I don't use that feature that often after all.Overall - Excellent headphones for all kinds of uses, and they sound great!9/10 - Overall superb, but get a little uncomfortable after a while\",\n",

But the problem with the double-rail bellows is that it lacks the precision of the Pentax single-rail bellows, which is a geared rack-and-pinion design, allowing for precise positioning.  The single-rail bellows, Pentax Bellows K, is also very steady and locks in place, which is extremely important because even slight movements affect focus in a magnification system, like a bellows.

The Twin Frozr fans never let the card get above 65C, even under full load, and it is surprisingly quiet.  Quieter than my old GTX 670 was by far (that card died).  The 4GB of VRAM is needed for me as I use multiple monitors.  MSI Kombuster and MSI Afterburnber work perfectly with this card allowing you to adjust the fan profiles/speeds and OC to your heart's content.This card is a real beast and is essentially a GTX 680 on steroids.  There is no current generation game that it can't handle on the highest of settings.  I get 70-80FPS with all settings maxed on Ultra on BF4.  Same with Watchdogs.  FPS often spike into the 100's.  Looks astounding.Almost bit the bullet and went for a GTX 780 for an extra $150, but that would have been way overkill seeing how well this card performs.  So glad I went for this card.  Yes it is a little pricey itself - but cards at this level are.  You pretty much get what you pay for.Highly recommended.  Fantastic graphics card.\",\n",

This card does HDX rendering with per-pixel lighting and handles all the texture load I can throw at it, with the exception of non-optimized ortho graphics that were ported over from FSX to X-Plane and poorly optimized.This card has NEVER disappointed me.  \"nuff said\"',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I wanted to do this review right.  I needed to give some time to test it in certain games under conditions that would allow me to see the potential of the card.  I will give a tl;dr at the end for those interested in the bottom-line of price versus performance.Size: MONSTROUS card.  It's every bit of a foot long and in my Alienware Aurora R4 case it covers both PCI-e 16x slots.  It isn't filling from the top slot to the bottom rack, but the dimensions are spot on.Build Quality: Top notch.  The card feels absolutely solid to hold.  The heatsink/spreader/fan combination had zero movement in it and that was even after I spent time harassing it to get it in my case.  If you have the Aurora R4 with the swing arm that is there to increase airflow, I suppose, I eventually just removed the swing arm because it was constantly making contact with my card.  I didn't want any vibrations of the card to work together with the air-flow cover to loosen the fan or heatsink.  If you are a pro with a dremel though, you might just be able to have your card and your air-flow cover.Temperature:  My most important category: I don't care about pulling exactly 120FPS, I want a card that is going to last me longer than a PS4 and the way to do that is to control the max temperature under load.  What good is a graphics card that rides the line of overheating and shortens the overall lifespan of the card?  I read that the Twin Frozr was the way to go for maintaining below reference card temperatures.  This card nails it with the idling temperature.  My GPU right now is at 23C and fluctuates between 23-28C at idle.  This is spectacular considering my stock 560 Ti idled between 32 and 35.  Under load is where the challenge arose.  The card itself has a feature that prevents it from getting much over 80C by turning down the voltage and power in order to keep it under that temp.  However my card seems to ride right at that temperature in Arkham Origins with everything maxed (including PhysX).  Keep in mind my experience may depend a lot on my case so for those of you with an R4, take note.  The first thing I had to do was grab MSI Afterburner Beta in order to get readings and power options.  I didn't program a custom fan profile in until I watched the graph and saw how long it held between 78C and 80C.  After that I programmed it for pushing the fan up to max if it got over 60C.  Now the issue was total airflow out of the case so for my R4 folks I had to put my 2 fans (HDD and PCI) up to 45% each for a balance of noise and performance.  After setting this up and not adjusting the card at all other than the fan profile with afterburner I hit took on Arkham Origins again maxed out.  **At load it was between 49C-55C**  So here is my advice, this card can run super cool when paired with Afterburner and a case fan setup.  However I recommend against popping this card in and hitting Battlefield 4 maxed for 10 hours because in my experience (in an Aurora R4) it was right near the programmed temperature threshold.  If you install afterburner though and kick up those fans play until your mouse breaks because this card is solid.Framerates: I couldn't honestly tell you because I use an HDTV and usually lock it with V-Sync to keep away from tearing.  Here is what I do know; I installed FRAPS for Skyrim so I could see how many graphical mods I could add before the card started to lose frames.  I have 52 mods running in game right now to include Skyrim HD 2K textures, Static Mesh Improvement Mod, Climates of Tamriel, W.A.T.E.R., Unofficial Followers Mod, Inconsequential NPCs, and many many others that change appearance of not only my character, but the looks of NPCs.  The card scoffed at my attempt to slow it down.  All of the textures I've used from the community are 2K including the clothing NPCs wear.  This card can handle all the Skyrim mods you want, for sure.  It also never dipped using any of the mods with FRAPS.  I was locked at 60, but it kept fighting me to go higher.  I also played through and beat Arkham Origins and despite the game glitches (which should be fixed by now) the card never stuttered or acted like it couldn't handle it.**I will update this section again soon as I am in the process of upgrading my monitor to 120hz.  I will do more FPS testing when I can go above 60FPS without tearing**Noise:  I had two ways of measuring this: with my case fans running at 45% and with my case fans at auto-speed.  When the fans are up in my R4 case the sounds of the fans on this card are barely audible.  When my case fans are off I can hear the card when it is turned all the way up.  Is it overly loud? No.  Can I hear it sitting two feet away from it at my desk? Yes.  Can I hear it with my headphones on?  Definitely no.  You take that for what it is worth, I played with the fan speeds in Afterburner to see what speeds were overly loud and which ones were tolerable.  I couldn't care less about the noise, I want my card at the lowest temp possible under load so this wasn't a big deal to me.Price Point:  This isn't an entry level card by any means.  I got this card because I determined that I wanted to upgrade my PC as opposed to buying a PS4.  Since the prices were about even (this was less with the rebate) I got the 770 (and 3 games).  4GB of VRAM is not a necessity and you may not need that much to accomplish what you want in gaming.  I got it for texture mods and potential texture upgrades in future games.TL;DR This card is built strong and gives powerful performance.  Idles in the 20C range and when paired with MSI Afterburner it rarely gets to 70C on full load.  It will handle all the Skyrim mods you can throw at it with the 4GB of VRAM and it doesn't stutter in all the games I've played maxed out.  The price point is the cost of a new console, but it comes with three games.  The people who will grab this card know who they are, but if you are looking for a card built with reliability in mind this one is definitely that choice.  I'll update this when I can to reflect my gaming experiences on a new monitor.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"First off, if you think about getting this, dont unless if you want to SLI (couple two cards to work together for x2 performance) The build quality and performance of the card is good its just that you can get away with spending less money depending on what you want to do with it.The 760 is not powerful enough to utilize all 4 gb of gpu memory by itself so dont bother if you are only in the market for 1 card. The 2 gb version is more than enough for applications and gaming at 1080p and is more than 50 $ cheaper. It would be redundant to get this graphics card to only use it by itself.To fully take advantage of 4 gb of video memory you need a second video card. The memory doesn't stack so you aren't getting 8 gb of total memory but everything else does, meaning all gpu intensive programs run a lot smoother. Although dropping all that money on TWO video cards is kind of the same as buying a single GTX 780, you are getting Titan killer performance at a fraction of the price. (600 sumthin vs a grand? awesome deal) You also only really need 4gb of video memory if you run at high resolutions, like a multi monitor set up, or run realy intense programs like heavily modded games or rendering.So you can pretty much justify for yourself if this videocard is worth it. You might say you are better off with just a 780 now and wait for a second 780 in the future for sli (twice the price but twice the titan killer:-). But it as it stands, its either this card in sli or something else.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Let me say this first. I'm not a gamer, so I have no idea how well this card works with games. I'm into 3d modeling and rendering --mostly with Daz Studio, Cinema 4D and Poser. I purchased Octane render a little while ago, and I needed to get myself a better video card. I had a GTX 650 Ti which was pretty good for everyday work, but inadequate for GPU based rendering. There are better cards out there for GPU Based Rendering --but I didn't have a thousand dollars to spend, so I tried to look for a good balance.The GTX 760 was a pretty good compromise, in my opinion. Render Speed improved significantly, as well as the image quality. I don't actually use the card at the moment to run my dual monitors --it actually sits in the box and works only when I render. The installation was remarkably simple. I don't recommend that you use the disk to install the drivers, though. That's not because they're bad --just out of date. You're going to end up downloading the updates anyway, so you may as well just do it from the start. The heat sinks make this thing feel like a barbell, but does a lot for heat dissipation.I like the performance of the card enough to consider putting in a second card just like this one and taking my GTX 650 Ti out of service. All the other things aside, the thing just works... period.\",\n",

Compared with displaylink usb video adapters this one seems to be buggy. When plugged into USB2.0 port the only resolution available is 800x600, and when plugged into USB3.0 port the whole screen flashes and goes dark periodically, while mouse movement is extremely laggy. This could be a driver issue but obviously this product is defective. In addition the included drivers which is version 1.xx.27 appears to be old and doesn't support my OS windows 8 very well. I tried to download the 1.xx.56 drivers from fresco logic's website but that one will not even finish installation before it rings up an error message saying the driver installation failed. This product should have failed QA with so many bugs, but even though it's about half the price of displaylink adapters it is useless as it does not work at all!\",\n",

I tried the devices on 2 different computers on 4 different monitors and 1 TV.  In each case I was unable to change the display resolution of the external display (stuck at 800x600, which is horrible).  This is obviously a far cry from the 1920x1080 promised.  In addition, on one of my PCs, I witness considerable flashing and screen tearing on the external display whenever my CPU is above idle, or when attempting to move a window (or even just my mouse) on the external display.For reference, here are some basic specs of my systems:System 1OS: Windows 7 SP1CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad q9450 @ 2.66 GHzRAM: 4 GBGraphics: AMD Radeon 4850 with latest catalyst driverSystem 2OS: Windows 7 SP1CPU: Intel Core 2 duoRAM: 2 GBIntegrated GraphicsI\\'ve sent an email to the company in hopes they can provide me with a solution. But unless I get one (and rather quickly), these devices will be going back, and I\\'ll look for a more reputable solution for my external display needs.EDIT:Well, I may have found the issue on my own.  Here is Orico\\'s product description page ([...] While the description on Amazon only mentions that both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 are supported, notice that Orico\\'s description page states the following:\"Multiple Monitors up to 800*600,when connected the USB 2.0 ports\".Apparently if you want a resolution higher than 800x600, you MUST be using USB 3.0! Unfortunately I don\\'t have any USB 3.0 ports on my PCs, so I can\\'t test this out. But user be warned, if you want the advertised resolution, make sure you have an available USB 3.0 port!',\n",

That, combined with the slight reduction in stroke length, does seem to increase my typing speed a bit when I'm too stressed to keep my keystrokes short enough to avoid impact.Unfortunately, that same reduction in stroke length seems to have increased how often I bottom, resulting in more shock overall.I'm trading off between two identical Max Blackbirds, one with these rings, one without, to see if there's really a perceptible difference. If so, I'll likely try the softer rings next.If your primary concern is to reduce the &#34;clack&#34; without ruining the feel of your keyboard, and you have no hand pain, these are probably perfect for you.\",\n",

With my unit, the headphones came out-of-the=box with right ear cup being disconnected from the headband. It was easily reconnected to mounting pegs which unfortunately also shows how easily they can get dislodged.

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought it for the parts, but have been impressed by the intangible extras.I wanted an Arduino board to dedicate to fooling around and trying new ideas -- for prototyping, in other words -- and got this because the baseplate holding the Arduino board and the breadboard in place next to each other is convenient for that kind of thing. The components collection looked worth the money, and the storage case is handy. Since I\\'d planned to buy all those things anyway, and I\\'d already had a good experience with Sparkfun*, I got this.It is fantastic.+ The parts are as listed, and a good variety for starting with. The case is unexpectedly sturdy: excellent for storage, and might even hold up to being carried around in a bag or backpack. The board is more or less an Uno with a mini-B connector most people probably have a cable lying around for. It even includes its own cable, which is a very visible Sparkfun red so it can\\'t wander off and blend into the nest of black snakes that all my other cables have coagulated into. (The Redboard Arduino and the breadboard are also red, making them easy to tell apart from other pieces already earmarked for specific projects.)- The translucent red breadboard is, as other reviewers have mentioned, a little hard to see and read. That board arrived with my kit, but a better-visibility replacement costs roughly $5 if you find it annoying, and Sparkfun has already responded to user feedback by replacing it in the newer kits.+++ The kit includes the usual basic LEDs-and-switches components, a motor, a servo, and an LCD screen, along with a handful of different kinds of sensors. Some of the sensors are not the basic, usual stuff I\\'ve seen in other kits and do a good job of spurring imagination. The included booklet introduces each in its own project, with multiple pictures and diagrams: here\\'s the circuit diagram, here\\'s a photo of the board, here\\'s a drawing of the connections, here\\'s a table showing what connects to what, and if one of these doesn\\'t clarify what\\'s confusing me another is sure to. While it explains everything you need to know, it leaves plenty as an exercise for the experimenter. For example, the temperature sensor reports to the serial console in project 7, but the LCD screen shows up as the last project, and combining them is left to the -- hey, that sounds fun, I\\'m going to go try that!...which is what I\\'ve seen a lot of from Sparkfun. The explanations and diagrams are clear and instructive; the projects are well-arranged in an order that allows them to build on each other. That\\'s nice to see in a starter kit, naturally; it should be possible to learn from. Sparkfun has hit on just the right way of explaining to prompt what-ifs and could-Is, though, and they do it by explaining everything you need to know to come up with questions or ideas on your own. (I also personally like the absence of splashy sunburst graphics or sidebars with cartoon faces asking \"Did you know?\" or \"See if you can...\" -- the kit is appropriate for children 10+, but it\\'s not just for kids nor does it talk down to adults.)++ Don\\'t skip downloading the SIK sketches from the URL given in the manual. Copied into the \"Examples\" folder of the Arduino program on your computer, the examples can be loaded in complete form with a few mouse clicks and uploaded to the Arduino board with one more. The sketches\\' code is extensively commented and basically makes up a second instruction manual, pairing learning about the code with learning about the hardware in a partly-decoupled way that lets the experimenter take on as much as they feel like digging into without requiring anything more.Apart from the slightly-less-than-ideal breadboard, my only complaint about this kit is that it\\'s so well-thought-out and the instructions so well-written and -illustrated that I feel obliged to go teach myself from the Web on some other board and give the kit to a friend who wants to learn and will be starting from square one. The components and physical pieces are of good quality, so I got what I wanted, but the thought that went into making it a convenient self-teaching tool with minimum confusion is outstanding.______________________________* I mentioned a good experience with Sparkfun. At a convention I attended last year, they hosted a panel showcasing their Lilypad wearable-computing line of sewable electronic components and Arduino board. Attendees were given the materials needed to embroider a decorative LED circuit. There were far more attendees than had been planned for, and logistics got complicated, but the Sparkfun reps handled it with grace and good humor. They had only budgeted a certain number of kits to give out, but they scrounged up more to make sure everyone at least had one to share with another person despite more than double the expected attendance. They were friendly, helpful, instructive, enthusiastic, patient, and generous. As far as dealing with the company itself goes, if I ever have a problem with a component -- and I mean this in the most complimentary possible way -- I want that component to be manufactured by Sparkfun.',\n",

Every component was intact when I received it and the installation process was really fast. If you are starting from scratch and don't own any components, this is the best kit you can get.

Everything is so much fun to put together.Like most beginner kits, this starts with your first blinking LED and builds and expands with each new lesson.  Personally, I like the way the book is organized, though I wish they could've put more of the programming in the book as opposed to just the example code.Another small issue is the red breadboard:  I could see how it would make wiring difficult.  I understand that they are swapping for a different colored board and they just have to go through their current supply.  So this is an issue that will be cleared up shortly.  Worst case scenario, you can buy a white breadboard of the same size for $5 or less.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'First let me say that I have used the earlier version of this kit for several years to teach Engineering to High School Students. I consider the Sparkfun kit to be the best educational kit on the market, and also the most useful for anyone interested in learning how to program microcontrollers. The Sparkfun kit is top of the line because it has an excellent array of components, crystal clear instructions that step you through projects in clear and logical fashion, and a wide range of fun projects. The instructions assume you know nothing, so a non-technical person can follow the instructions and achieve working projects, as they learn the ins and outs of microcontroller programming and circuit design.This kit is well suited for a variety of age groups. For younger learners, the kit shows how to hook things up, and you can then even download the programs to make it work. From there, students can begin to write their own code to make it do new and different things, but they are encouraged because they are starting from the point of a working device. The frustration factor with these kits is very low, the fun factor is very high, and the students LOVE to learn with them.The kit has everything you need to hook up and start programming.Now, some specifics on this upgraded model compared to the earlier version of the kit. This kit includes an LCD display which is a welcome addition to the lineup. The LCD is easy to program and ads a valuable new dynamic to projects. Also, the kit corrected a few minor glitches in the earlier version and an upgraded version of the arduino.I have found that high school freshmen are fully cabable of learning how to program using this kit. The students taking the engineering class based on this kit love the class, and many of them come in an hour before school starts to play with their kit. Many come in over lunch and after school as well.This is a great teaching tool and a great learning tool. Sparkfun is a great company, and this kit is an excellent entry into the exciting world of microcontrollers.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I am a complete novice to Arduino, and was looking for a good starter kit. This kit comes with the basic components, and an excellent booklet with step by step instructions on getting started. After the first few projects, I realized how easy it is to work with Arduino, and that I did not need to be afraid to try to purchase the individual components. But I am glad to have paid the premium, if only for saving me the aggravation to have my project not working and not knowing how to troubleshoot it. With this kit, I knew that if something didn't work, it was due to me making a mistake somewhere, and not a defective component. After acquiring some experience, for my next projects I bought much cheaper parts, and by that time I knew how to troubleshoot them, and was aware of some of the incompatibilities. What this kit gave me was the initial encouragement by making everything so easy. The booklet that comes with it alone was worth the price of the kit to me. All of this kit's components are available individually, with many cheaper offerings. There is also a plenty of information to get you started, but I do not regret having paid the extra. Also, paying for Sparkfun's products supports this excellent company and their projects.\",\n",

Check the MoKo case reviews for other tablet models and you'll see nothing but 4 and 5 stars, and this one is no different.  Fits my Iconia W3 like a glove.  The tablet fits securely with no slippage and none of the ports are covered. You can easily charge the tablet and use the headphone, microUSB and microSD while the cover is closed.  The bezel has cutouts around the top, bottom and sides so that you can easily use Windows 8 gestures.  It looks great, closes securely, and folds to an easel that places the tablet at a good viewing angle. There is a magnet in the cover that holds the cover closed and puts the tablet in sleep mode.  The hand strap and elastic strap on my cover are tight and work perfectly.  No problems at all.\",\n",

The picture was sharp after adjusting the lens. It should work great for what I will be using it for, which will be in my backyard at night to entertain guest. The lens is kind of cheaply made but its not too bad it adjusts, the SD card slot worked, it played my movies from SD card, it also has a hole for a tripod to be attached, it light weight and compact and I like it a lot, for the cost it is a good deal. I would recommend for something like playing movies at home for family and friends but definitely not for professional uses.',\n",

So that if it was stolen or got wet I wouldnt be out a lot of money.  For my purposes is works very well.You do need to work with the controls a bit.  everything is centered around the ENTER button.  Including the video input selection.  This is NOT plug and play.  You must select the type of input for the projector to work.It is lightweight, small and comes with a mini tri pod.  So if this fits your bill then buy it.  If you are looking for 1080P then skip this unit and look elsewhere.  Otherwise for $60 +/- its a good buy.\",\n",

I went with all Sunwayfoto parts and couldn't be happier.  Usually when you think of &#34;made in China&#34; you think &#34;cheap and poor quality&#34;, but these actually are really nice.  You can definitely feel the fluid dampening which provides a nice and smooth rotation.  The clamps themselves are solid and have a nice anodizing.  The lock to prevent rotation had no problem holding my Canon 7D, battery grip and lens in position at any horizontal or vertical angle imaginable.  I suppose it would be nice if the bubble level was larger and not recessed (once you put a rail there you can't see it anymore), but realistically speaking that turns out to be a non-issue since the Sunwayfoto rails have bubble levels too.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My monitor is a Lilliput 7\" model 664/O/P, or \"slim\". There are several versions of the 664, depending on which features are included.It includes: Peaking, Histogram, and Zebra Stripes to indicate areas with blown highlights. At the time I bought mine the 664 was the lightest weight model at 365 grams, or 12.875 ounces. I looked at other field monitors with smaller dimensions, but this particular Lilliput was lighter than some 5\" monitors.The USA distributor is Viviteq, located in California. I purchased directly from Viviteq through Amazon for a couple of reasons. One, someone had posted having problems getting service when they had purchased through Amazon. Two, Viviteq offered a carry case for no extra charge. When traveling, my tiny camcorder fits inside the hard suitcase with the monitor.Some of the monitors of this particular model had some problems with color shift after being put into Peaking mode. The color shifted to a dirtyish yellow while in Peaking, then returned to the default saturation, which was too high, every time Peaking was turned off. My first one had the problem. Viviteq answered my emails promptly and had a monitor calibrated in China set to my own personal saturation preference. I was allowed to keep the first monitor while this was done. Once my replacement arrived in California, I had to send mine in.  Viviteq paid shipping. Once Viviteq had received my first, they sent my second, so I was without for a little over a week. My second works great and I don\\'t work without it.The clarity is fabulous. The high definition image lets me see clearly when I\\'m in focus. I have HDMI in and out and expect to use the in capability in studio to be able to see on a larger monitor.I use Peaking sometimes when I want to be absolutely sure I\\'m in focus. Peaking color can be selected from four choices, white, blue, red, or green. The monitor can also be put in black and white mode for peaking, if desired. I like the ability to select color. When shooting anything in trees against the sky, red is good. When shooting begonias with red tips on the leaves, blue is good. For anyone who is color blind the ability to change peaking color could make a lot of difference.My camera happens to have both zebra stripes and histogram, so I seldom use those features. Lilliput has other 664 models without the extras that are less expensive.There are other brands of field monitors. Marshall is apparently well thought of my professionals. I simply couldn\\'t justify the extra cost for a Marshall and now that I\\'ve used this Lilliput, I don\\'t see how it could be any better.... well, except the screen is so glossy sometimes I see myself more than my subject. Don\\'t care for that. I\\'ve purchased a Photodon Anti Glare Sample Pack, but have yet to try any of them.[...]The Lilliput comes with two battery holder adapters. One of the supplied adapters holds the same battery my Canon 7D uses, so I purchased a second battery and charger. Unfortunately the Canon 7D battery is such a tight fit that it can be quite difficult to get it out.  I take the entire adapter off, then take the battery out.  While filming on location it was so hard to get the battery out while in a hurrry that I pressed too hard and my battery winded up hitting the pavement.  Still works fine, but...Other battery holder plates are available. Oh, and there is an electric cord that can be plugged into the wall when working near an electrical source. I use that often.There are many adjustments that can be made, such as variable brightness. A rectangular line can be set to appear onscreen that gives you a visual guide that can be adjusted to any of several sizes to give an estimate of safe margins, title safe margins, etc. The screen is IPS. That means you can see it from an angle, which is great.The tiny ball head that comes with it is horrid. I happened to have assorted camera connection parts and rigged up a more stable connection.I feel like giving this a 4 due to the battery holder being so tight, the ball head feeling unsafe, but the fact is, I LOVE IT!  I don\\'t work without it.  Before I had it at least 1/3 of everything I filmed was out of focus in at least a portion of the footage.  Now I can clearly see exactly what is happening.  I hope the battery adapter will become easier over time and as I said, I replaced the ball head immediately because it didn\\'t feel safe.Love it.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I tested side by side with Ikan vk7i. I decided to return ikan for few reasons. Ikan seemed to have clearer brighter screen and colors out of the box was great. However ikan only does peaking in monochrome. The startup and delay from record to playback was also quicker like 5 seconds vs 664 7 seconds.The 664 was slim and much lighter which is great for run and gun shooting. The screen is not as crisp and clear as ikan but good enough.  Playing with color settings I was able to get color to get ok close to ikan. It also does peaking in color mode which i prefer as well as monochrome. It also has many more options like zoom up to 8 times. It also comes with sunshade and both popular battery plates.  The peaking on 664 did not see to be as good as ikan but it was good enough.Overall 664 gives most bang for buck and its slim weight was my biggest deciding factor. You just need to play a lot with color settings to get it close to correct.  If you can put the ikan high screen quality in 664 size as well as its quick response time with 664 plethora of menu options then you have winner.',\n",

I also really like that it has elastic that holds the flap in place for when you hold the device by the strap. It feels sturdy and comfortable. Unlike the SuperCase that felt flimsy. I also like the grooves it has to hold your device in landscape mode. I am a little worried about the locking mechanism though. Since it brushes against the bezel, I am worried about wear or discoloration.Lastly, I do love the color. While my favorite color is black, this one stands out more and is more visible in the dark.

The On/off feature works flawlessly and really is a must for me since I hate having to push the little side button. The little stand works well in both positions and is rather sturdy unless you are really forceful when tapping your screen. The one upright position is rather steep, but depending on where you sit it may be just right. The stylus it comes with is nice. Although it feels like a cheap pen, it glides smoothly over the screen. The only complaint I have is where the stylus holder is positioned. They have it on the back so when you try to open up your case all the way and just hold your tablet,  there is an annoying bump and the flap can't lay flat. Because I usually hold my tablet like that I end up just taking the stylus out. Overall, this is a good case at a really awesome price!\",\n",

I like the look of the case, and they way the cover folds provides both a stand and a grip when holding the device to take a picture.  The way the cover slips into the tab on the back prevents the cover from covering up the camera lens.  The touch stylus is a nice addition.On the downside, you need to &#34;break-in&#34; the cover to have it hold it's most upright position in horizontal orientation - I found that if you remove the Nexus, open the cover, fold it along the open folds, and then place it in a vice overnight, it holds it's better at holding it's shape.The cover does not allow you to have the Nexus stand in a vertical (portrait) orientation - which is not a big problem, but it would have been nice.One thing to consider when choosing a cover:  A big advantage of the Google Nexus 7 (2013), is that it can provide a tablet experience, but can still fit in many adult male back pants pockets.  This advantage is undone if you put the device in almost any cover.Still, if you're looking for something that feels like a refined version of your old Day Planner/Day Runner, you won't go wrong with a Google Nexus 7 (2013) in this cover.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The case and stylus are awesome value and good quality. The price I paid was so low I was skeptical about what I was going to receive. The only issue with the case and why I deducted 1 star is that it does not stand up like the picture very well. There is just not enough flat base to support it in this position. Not something I\\'m going to over complain about because of the price I paid. I feel like I got more than my monies worth.A few hours after posting the review above, I received a friendly email from the seller reaching out to me with photos of what they thought my problem was with the ProCase not standing as the sales picture. Because the case is new and the leather, although soft, is still not broken in to fold square enough to create the proper foundation. The picture they sent showed me to create a fold at the proper point and now it does exactly what the picture shows. Over time it would have broken in, but now I did not have to wait or continue bracing it with something else. Thank you!I want to say that even though I felt like my original review was still a good review that pointed out the fact that this is an awesome case at a unbelievable value should have still helped people decide to buy, they really wanted to help me with my problem. The email the seller sent was written with concern to help me, and not about getting a 4 out of 5 stars or my review. For that reason I wanted to take this opportunity to point out \"Tech Vender\" is a great company to deal with, and they have earned all the success they get. I will recommend them to everyone I can for their fantastic customer service that saw a customer with a minor issue and wanted to help anyway they could. As for the 5th Star, they get that because the Nexus 7 stood!Way to go ProCase and Tech Vendor!!!!!',\n",

The magnet(s) do hold the cover closed, but I wish it was a stronger closure to ensure it doesn\\'t open inadvertently, maybe a small velcro strap.2. The \"wake up on open\" is a great feature, but is a bit flaky - about 1 in 10 times, the Nexus doesn\\'t wake up. Dunno whether that happens due to the case or due to the Nexus.

This problem exists with all of the cases with the sleep/wake feature as the the problem is with the device itself, not the case. Rest assured, the case is doing what it's supposed to; the Nexus itself is the thing that seems to be finicky with the wake function.If you find that your device isn't turning on when you open the case, try turning the WiFi on. My friend has a case from another manufacturer and it also has trouble turning the Nexus on when the WiFi is off.

The included stylus/pen was a nice touch and it works well. The sleep wake function works as expected. The handstrap on the inside of the case is a nice touch that helps with gripping the tablet.So why only 3 stars??? Well the stand feature is a pain to use! When you fold the cover back into a triangle shape to form the stand, the bottom bows slightly and cause the tablet to rock forward when it's sitting on a flat surface. You can actually see this in one of the product photos here.Another small gripe I have is that it is super thick! I also own a Poetic Slimline case and this ProCase is almost 2.5 times thicker than that!I'm hoping that the case will loosen up after some use and the stand will work better after a while.\",\n",

The clear screen protector was an excellent fit and very easy to apply. Small air bubbles disappeared overnight, leaving very good optical clarity. The protector itself is slightly tacky, as is the case with similar competing products of this material, but this is easily rectified with an application of spray wax (either household or automobile type).  More disappointing is the full body protection skin. The skin covers the back of the tablet well with a good fit, however the sides do not adhere well and small flaps of the skin that are made to extend around the top edge of the tablet will not remain adherent at all. I would suggest saving a few dollars and purchasing only the screen protector while avoiding the full body skin. You are better served in applying the difference to a good protective case.',\n",

The only issue I had was to gather up the packaging and the additional parts which were not required and toss them into the trash.  I do live within 30 miles of a major urban area but I've noticed no loss of signal or clarity of sound.  I've also about 45 miles from the mountains so that will be a good signal and clarity test within the coming months.  I previously had a new Carbon Fiber stubby antenna which broke off, where the Carbon Fiber attached to the base, within two months.

Just make you wash user hand.The backing looks great too, if you press hard against the logo parts, it will come out. My only complaint would be the corner which can be easily remedied by cutting a small notch and wrapping them around.Good protector for the value, and if anything goes wrong I will update my review.NOTE : If you want to see the picture of it go to these link[...]  - (This one shows the corner of it, after I made the notch)[...] - (This shows the logo and everything)-----------Update-----------I think its important that I mention this..... The screen protector itself is very odd. What i mean it I have this weird air bubbles that wont go away, and it also have wierd dimple like things.

I have it connected into my Linn system via a Sonos Connect and a Cardas 75 ohm digital cable.Well, things have changed now, and I now have the wonderful, involving musical experience I had been looking for. Music played through the system now draws you in, you hear the music, the tempo, a wealth of micro-informational details that make for an engaging, fascinating listening experience. I have not made A/B comparisons etc. of the DAC-ITx with other DACs, at some point we have to say enough splitting hairs, are you happy or not with the way is sounds. After some initial hesitation and doubt regarding the Peachtree, I\\'m now thrilled with this DAC\\'s performance. Perhaps the digital cable needed some breaking-in time, or maybe the DAC itself, although that would be surprising. In any case, I have now \"found the sound\"... DAC-ITx is highly recommended.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"FIrst, I should divulge that I purchased my DAC-ITx directly from Peachtree. I am posting this review because it seems to be a bit overlooked on Amazon. You cannot beat this DAC at its current price. I was a little concerned when it first arrived. The packaging and presentation are definitely not luxurious. Nevertheless, the DAC arrived in good condition, and it now looks perfectly at home with the other products in my stereo/AV system (Rega, Denon, Oppo, Mac...). It is connected to my Mac Mini via USB, and to a current generation Apple TV via TosLink. Both connections were completely &#34;plug and play,&#34; no complications at all. I don't have anything to connect to the Coax input at this time. The sound is clear, full, and robust. The stereo separation seems especially wide. I love having discreet buttons for each input rather than having to toggle between them with one button, a wheel, or a switch. There are absolutely no switching or spurious noises of any kind generated through the outputs. This is the only DAC that I could find in this price range with a remote control. Although I didn't think this would be a big deal at the time of purchase, I find myself using the remote every day. Overall, I would say that this is probably the best value there is in this price range. Do not hesitate to buy it, especially if you have committed to the Apple platform for your digital media sources.\",\n",

Sounds have a clean dimensional quality and presence. My initial happiness turned to gloom when the unbelievably insubstantial remote, which is required to make the DAC respond, failed within 24 hours. It is the ONLY way to switch inputs on the front of the DAC, even though the three backlit &#34;buttons&#34; feel as though they are responding to being pushed. Why do these companies do this? Without the cheesy little remote your 400 dollar DAC is useless.I returned the unit, because I'm so disappointed that the design could entail this ridiculous vulnerability.Too bad, Peachtree.

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased my ITX directly through Peachtree, so let me say that first off. But I did want to write a review here, because I only see one other, and I think it deservers more.I'm so happy with this product! First of all, note I have never liked the sound of CDs. I find them strident, and they gave me a headache. I was looking for a DAC that could hopefully change that. After reading loads of reviews, it came down to a tossup between the Bifrost and the Peachtree. I decided to try the Peachtree. I'm glad I did. The fact is, I love the sound of this box. Whereas in the past the CD had a schrill, screechy sound, with highs that stung my ears, that distortion is now gone, and is replaced by a sound I can only discribe as effervescent. It is like lovely sparkling mineral water vs. tap water. I don't know how else to explain it. The sound is a joy to listen to. In all those places that used to cause pain, I now hear sparkling sound. I've now purchased a whole batch of CDs (unheard of for me!!!), which I love to listen to. They sound like vinyl records or pure master tapes wihhout the popping or hissing. The true promise of CD's finally delivered! Isn't that what we've always wanted? The pure sound w/out the background hiss or scratches, and all the excitment of it coming right off the wide master tape!  Just so you know, I listen with a pair of Grado GS1000i's, which is one of the best headphones on the market, my headphone amp is the Asgard 2, which is a perfect match for the Grados, and my turntable is a Panasonic 5.25 inch Blu-ray player that I installed on my computer. I run that to my Peachtree with a Monster USB cable.I'm sure that if one goes higher up the food chain, such as the NAD M51, they will get greater definition, but this is still a great unit. In looking at the many other reivews of the Peachtree ITX, I found the concensus above all was the musicality and pleasureableness of the listening. Indeed, I have found my foot tapping to CDs, something I thought was impossible! If transforming your strident CDs into a joyful experience is what you've always hoped for, if you like the thought of effervescent, sparkly highs (and you will), then go for it!\",\n",

I just got done with a project that used a couple of these for some wide area networking proof of concept appliances, I came a away pretty impressed. Reasonably powerful, and fairly simple to set up, pre-made images are pretty readily available for a number of Linux distributions. The libraries that come with the angstrom distribution on the card are f'ed up - there's some sort of version mis-match or something and its impossible to get things to compile correctly if you are building software on them (problems with flock() etc.). I ended up using  Debian wheezy and everything worked out fine. The sound cards are also a little strange to get into line, I'd look at the beaglebone black with some atod and dtoa converters instead of relying on the built in card to do anything that you need precise control over. Also get a good power supply and don't try to power over usb, as it will pretend to boot but then hit a kernel panic. Anyway, really flexible and easy to get going once you get over the initial pitfalls. The hdmi was a life saver for diagnostics as was the built-in network card.\",\n",

Previously, I used component cables from the cable company STB to the TV, and an HDMI cable from my A/V receiver to the TV. I wanted to split the signal from the STB to go to both the A/V receiver and the TV. Also, since it is a smart TV, I wanted to split the signal from the Blu-Ray Disc player to not only go to the A/V  receiver, but directly to the TV also (to give me the option of TV speakers or my surround sound 5+1 speakers). So, getting two of these splitters with an adapter (to eliminate getting more HDMI cables) was just what I needed. I like the powered adapter because from what I read a splitter without power does not give as clean a signal. This splitter accomplishes everything I needed for less than the alternative, and provides excellent signals to the TV. The images on the TV screen really 'pop' at you!

Also, I had to turn off UEFI (using Legacy instead) due to the RAID configuration, using 2 x 128GB drives.Pros:- Small, but good performance- So far, battery life has been pretty good, especially if you use a darker display brightness setting (I'll try to get actual figures soon on battery life under &#34;normal&#34; use)- Comes with a nice case (though it doesn't have a slot for the included VGA/Ethernet adapter, if I'm being critical)Cons:- If you can call it a 'con,' the full 1920x1080 setting makes things very small for my taste.  I had to drop it to 1600x900 to have the desktop icons set at a readable size.  People with worse vision might want even lower...- They keyboard layout is a little goofy (Fn key required for home, end, function keys...) but that's the price you pay for a small laptop.\",\n",
